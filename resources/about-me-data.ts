        "Over the past 4 years, I've been implementing user friendly UIs and experiences. I've tackled a diverse range of projects spanning e-commerce, agri-tech, edtech, and SaaS products. Throughout my work, I've collaborated with fellow engineers and product designers to bring these experiences to life. It's been a wild ride, but an incredibly rewarding one!",
        "When I'm not writing code, you'll find me either listening to music, writing (usually unpublished rants and or poems ðŸ™ƒ), or visiting family."
